### Image2Text

## Ground Rules Github.

* Always keep your fork (origin) updated with the master branch of the master (upstream).

    `git fetch upstream`

    `git rebase upstream/master`

    where upstream is https://github.com/alfvj17/Image2Text.

* Don't push directly to the repository, always push to your own fork first and from there do a Pull request to the main repo.

* Write meaningful commit messages.

* Keep the frontend and backend in code separated.

* The master is always stable, please don't edit the master branch directly.

* Don't work on master branch, whatever you're doing, make a feature branch, the master branch should always be stable.

## Violation of the ground rules are punishable by death.
